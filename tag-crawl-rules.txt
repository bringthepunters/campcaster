name: ParksVic campground tag extraction rules
version: 0.2
output: landscape_tags (1–3) + animals_fauna (open list, exact words)

LANDSCAPE TAGS (controlled list)
- beach_coast
- river_creek
- lake_wetland
- forest
- rainforest
- grassland_plains
- scrub_heath
- desert_arid
- mountains_alpine
- valley_gorge
- rocky_cliffs

ANIMALS (open list)
- animals_fauna: extract exact animal words/phrases found on the page (no normalising)

STEP 1 — Get page text
- Fetch the campground page
- Extract visible text from the main content area
- Remove header/nav/footer and "related links" blocks

STEP 2 — Decide landscape_tags (score + pick top 1–3)
- Score each tag based on strong cues in the text.
- Choose the top 1–3 tags by score.
- If nothing scores above a minimum threshold, return [] (never guess).

SCORING RULES (simple concept cues)
A) beach_coast
  - ocean/coast/beach/bay/surf/dunes/headland/foreshore/clifftop/tidal

B) river_creek
  - river/creek/stream/riverbank/banks/ford/estuary/river mouth

C) lake_wetland
  - lake/lagoon/wetland/billabong/marsh/swamp/floodplain

D) forest
  - forest/bushland/tall trees/canopy/shaded

E) rainforest
  - rainforest/fern gully/mossy forest/closed canopy

F) grassland_plains
  - plains/grassland/open country/pasture/downs

G) scrub_heath
  - heath/scrub/mallee/shrubland/low bush

H) desert_arid
  - desert/arid/semi-arid/red sand/saltbush/dunes

I) mountains_alpine
  - mountain/alpine/high plains/peaks/ridge/snow

J) valley_gorge
  - valley/gorge/ravine/canyon/gully

K) rocky_cliffs
  - rocky/boulders/granite/outcrop/escarpment/cliffs

TIEBREAKS
- If both beach_coast and river_creek score high and the text suggests river mouth/estuary, allow both.
- Do not output more than 3 landscape_tags.

STEP 3 — Extract animals_fauna (open list, exact wording)
- Look for a section titled "Wildlife" (if present) and scan it
- Also scan for sentences that contain "see/spot/observe/encounter" or "home to"
- Extract the noun phrase(s) referring to animals, keeping the exact text as written
- Split "X and Y" into separate entries unless it’s a fixed phrase
- De-duplicate case-insensitively, but keep the first-seen form

OUTPUT (per campground)
- campground_name
- page_url
- landscape_tags: ["beach_coast", "forest"]  (1–3)
- animals_fauna: ["koalas", "abundant birdlife", "seals"]  (0..N exact phrases)
