This includes the control of introduced plant and animal species. As part of an ongoing strategy, notice is hereby given that Parks Victoria will be laying buried baits containing Sodium Monofluoroacetate (1080 poison) and PAPP (4-aminopropiophenone) on public land for the control of foxes. Parks Victoria will also be deploying Canid Pest Ejector bait stations containing Sodium Monofluoroacetate (1080 poison) PAPP (4-aminopropiophenone) on public land for the control of foxes. Humane trap cages will be used for controlling feral cats. Baits containing 1080 poison will be laid from November 2025 to July 2026. These works will assist in protecting threatened animals such as the Helmeted Honeyeater, Lowland Leadbeater\u2019s Possum, Southern Brown Bandicoots, Broad tooth rat and Glossy Grass Skinks from predation by foxes and cats. Bait and Trapping Stations will be laid at strategic sites, and other known areas of fox and cat habitat, within the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Area, Bunyip State Park and Kurth Kiln Regional Park. Notification signage will be posted throughout the Pest Animal Control areas and members of the public who are living, visiting, or working in the above-named areas are advised to take particular care not to disturb or interfere with bait stations or cages. While domestic dogs and cats are particularly susceptible to 1080 and PAPP poisons, they are not permitted in Yellingbo Nature Conservation Area or Bunyip State Park and dogs must be always on lead when in Kurth Kiln Regional Park."
